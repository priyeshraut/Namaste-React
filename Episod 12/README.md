# Redux Toolkit

-- Install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-dedux
-- Build our store
-- Connect our store to our app
-- slice (cartSlice)
-- dispatch (action)
-- Selector


there is a diff b/w two libraries redux.js toolkit or rtk library has things to do with redux so creating a store is a redux thing that is why configure sotre come from redux-toolkit but we have to provide the store to our react application so it's kind of like a bridge b/w our react application and redux so that is why provider comes from react-redux
